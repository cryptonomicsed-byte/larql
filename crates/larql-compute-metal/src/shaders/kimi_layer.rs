//! The router→expert-binding seam, on device.
//!
//! Rung 5d, and the only part of a Kimi decoder layer that is not already
//! a Metal kernel. The residuals and RMS norms are trivial and the crate
//! already has them; the MoE and KDA are done. What was missing is the
//! link that decides WHICH experts run — and it is the link that decides
//! whether a layer is closed at all.
//!
//! ## Why this is the crux
//!
//! The shape to avoid is:
//!
//! ```text
//! GPU router -> read top-8 to the host -> host builds an offset table
//!            -> submit the GPU MoE
//! ```
//!
//! That reintroduces the ~0.23 ms crossing rungs 3 through 5c spent
//! their whole budget removing, once per layer, for the sake of eight
//! integers. The grouped expert kernel already carries expert identity
//! in an **offset table** rather than in a row's position, so the fix is
//! available: if that table lives in a device buffer, a router kernel
//! can write it and the expert kernel can read it later in the same
//! encoder, and the host never learns which experts ran.
//!
//! ## Residency is a separate problem, and this refuses rather than
//! guessing
//!
//! **The router answers WHICH expert, and nothing else.** Where that
//! expert's bytes live is resolved per projection by
//! `kimi_expert_addresses`, because a logical expert may sit at a
//! different physical slot in each of gate/up/down. A single address
//! emitted here would be a shared coordinate across the three, which is
//! exactly the invariant that must not exist.
//!
//! An address, once asked for, can be answered two ways:
//!
//! * **A full execution-shaped bank** holds every expert at its own
//!   index, so the address IS the identity: `offset = expert * stride`.
//!   Nothing is tabulated and no selection can be unaddressable. This is
//!   what a compiled VINDEX writes.
//! * **A packed subset** holds only some experts, so it needs a table,
//!   and a selection outside it has no address. Reading one anyway would
//!   be a plausible wrong answer from another expert's weights, so
//!   `expert_offsets` carries a sentinel and the kernel counts every
//!   refusal into `refusals` for the host to read after the wait — the
//!   same device-counts / host-refuses discipline `route_guard` uses.
//!
//! `identity_stride` selects between them: non-zero means the first,
//! and the table is not consulted at all.
//!
//! The distinction is ADDRESSABILITY, not residency. Whether an
//! addressable expert's pages happen to be resident is a paging concern
//! the model does not express, and conflating the two would make a
//! compiled bank look like a 256-entry residency claim.
//!
//! ## Selection is a threadgroup reduction, and it had to be
//!
//! The first version had one thread run `top_k` passes of argmax over
//! the experts — 2048 comparisons, which looked like nothing beside a
//! 121 MiB expert read. Measured, that single-threaded scan cost **0.98
//! ms**, more than the attention (0.47) and the whole MoE (0.47)
//! together, and turned a layer that should have been faster than the
//! host into 0.86x of it. A GPU core running one thread is not a fast
//! CPU; it is a very slow one.
//!
//! So each pass is a tree reduction over the whole threadgroup, and the
//! tie rule is carried through it explicitly: a candidate wins on a
//! strictly greater score, or on an equal score with a LOWER index.
//! That reproduces `kimi_router::route`'s "descending by selection
//! score, ties by ascending index" exactly rather than approximately —
//! the comparator is associative and commutative under those rules, so
//! the tree and the scan agree.
