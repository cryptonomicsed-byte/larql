//! BF16 grouped-expert dispatch — every selected expert in one launch.
//!
//! The bf16 sibling of [`MetalBackend::q6k_grouped_experts`], sharing its
//! [`InputLayout`] / [`ExpertOffset`] / [`GroupedError`] vocabulary so
//! the family has one contract rather than one per codec. Its own file
//! because `grouped_experts.rs` is already 564 lines and this crate caps
//! at 800.
//!
//! Rung 1 measured that the GPU arm was submission-bound, not
//! bandwidth-bound, and that batching nine expert GEMVs into one command
//! buffer won 4.68x on its own. This is the next question: whether the
//! residue is occupancy. See [`crate::shaders::bf16_grouped_experts`]
//! for the argument and the numbers behind it.
