//! Tests for [`super`] — the stage attribution arithmetic.
//!
//! Everything here runs without a device, which is the point:
//! [`super::profile_from_samples`] documents itself as "pure, so the
//! arithmetic is testable without a device", and the fold it performs is
//! what turns a raw timestamp array into the per-stage numbers a report
//! is read from. A mistake in that fold does not crash — it produces a
//! plausible attribution that sends someone optimising the wrong kernel.
//!
//! The device-touching half ([`super::StageProfiler`], `gpu_span_ms`,
//! `resolve_timestamps`) is deliberately not reached from here: those
//! need a real command buffer with resolved counters, and asserting on
//! them without one would pin a mock rather than the GPU.
