//! What this server will and will not do, answered by the server.
//!
//! The Explorer contract's premise (`docs/runtime-lifecycle-design.md`
//! and the Explorer programme's step 3) is that a client must never
//! infer a server's powers from its hostname — "localhost means I may
//! encode, https means read-only" is a guess, and a guess that is
//! wrong in the permissive direction offers a button that fails. So
//! the server says.
//!
//! The risk in saying it is that the answer becomes a second,
//! hand-maintained list beside the router: a table that claims
//! `components: true` while `/v1/components` was never mounted moves
//! the guess from the client into the server rather than removing it.
//!
//! So no boolean here is written down. Every route-backed capability
//! is derived from [`MountedRoutes`] — the ledger `routes::mod`
//! records *while it builds the router* — through the one table
//! [`ROUTE_CAPABILITIES`], which names, for each advertised key, the
//! route whose presence **is** that capability. Consequences worth
//! stating:
//!
//! - A capability cannot be advertised without the route existing.
//! - A route this server does not mount reports `false` on every
//!   profile, with no "unsupported" list to maintain.
//! - The rung that mounts `/v1/plan` flips `sources.plan.*` to `true`
//!   without editing this file.
//! - `tests/test_capabilities.rs` re-reads the same question through
//!   axum's own matcher (a method-mismatch probe: 405 means the path
//!   is mounted, 404 means it is not) and asserts the two readings
//!   agree, per profile. The ledger is checked, not trusted.
//!
//! Two facts here are *not* route-derived, and are marked as such:
//! the accepted source reference forms (read from the resolver's own
//! classifier, [`crate::bootstrap::classify_source`]) and the
//! execution backends ([`V3_BACKENDS`]).
