//! The token mixer, as the container declares it.
//!
//! Two facts, kept apart on purpose. **Identity** comes from the
//! graph's `attention[n].operator` — the checkpoint's judgement,
//! written once at encode time and required on read since
//! GRAPH_SCHEMA 6. **Operands** come from the op plan, which binds
//! tensors to the roles that operator computes with.
//!
//! Reading identity off the operands instead is the defect this
//! module exists to prevent. Before it, `mixer_label` matched
//! `LayerAttention::softmax()` and treated every `None` as Gated
//! DeltaNet, so Kimi Linear's `KKKM KKKM …` interleave — 20 KDA
//! layers and 7 MLA — printed as twenty-seven Gated DeltaNet layers,
//! and `describe layer.3.mixer` answered `GATED DELTANET` over an
//! empty operand table rather than refusing. A container that knows
//! exactly what it is was read as something it is not, confidently.
//!
//! So every match here is exhaustive over [`LayerOperator`] with no
//! wildcard arm: a new operator variant is a compile error in this
//! file, never a silent fall-through to whichever label happens to be
//! last.
