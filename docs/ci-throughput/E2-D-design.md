# CI-E2-D — tiered Metal evidence (DESIGN, not activated)

**Nothing in this document is wired to a trigger.** The manifest and the
classifier ship; `larql-compute-metal.yml` is untouched. E2-D is held
until E2-A's A1 sample closes, because D changes *which* pull requests
enter the Metal population and A measures *how long* the gate takes for
the ones that do. Landing them together would give a freshly-corrected
instrument two simultaneous attribution problems — the bill E1's C2
already paid.

## The question D answers

A asked: how long should the Metal gate take? Answer so far, 24m52s and
23m00s against a 56.61-minute baseline.

D asks a different one: **how often should we pay that at all?**

Over pull requests #415–#449, 18 triggered the Metal gate and **12 of
them (67%) touched no Metal file** — three were `Cargo.lock` alone.

## Why not better globs

`crates/larql-compute/**` holds two different kinds of thing:

- the trait boundary Metal **links** against — a change breaks the
  compile, and a compile catches it;
- the CPU kernels Metal's tests **compare numbers** against — 72
  references to `cpu::ops::q4_common` alone. A change here changes what
  the Metal kernels are required to reproduce, and only running them
  finds out.

No amount of directory ancestry separates those. So the distinction is
**declared**, in `crates/larql-compute-metal/parity-obligations.json`.

### The correction that motivated this, corrected again

`larql-compute/src/cpu/kquant_gemv.rs` (#420) was cited twice in the
design discussion as the case proving globs cannot work. On inspection it
is not: #420 **added** that file (+113/−0), it is referenced only from
`cpu/mod.rs`, and its consumer is `larql-vindex`'s opplan executor. The
Metal crate neither imports it nor reaches it.

It still classifies **tier A** here — because `cpu/**` is declared parity
under the asymmetry below, and that entry is marked `needs_review` with
this exact question attached. One review decision moves one pull request
in the sample. That is the honest size of the uncertainty, stated rather
than hidden.

## The asymmetry that decides every uncertain call

> A surface wrongly placed in **tier B is unsafe** — Metal compiles
> against changed numerics and never re-qualifies.
> A surface wrongly placed in **tier A is merely expensive.**

So uncertain goes to A, and every entry that is there by default rather
than by a positive finding carries `confidence: needs_review` and the
question that would settle it. Five of eleven entries currently do.

## The tiers

| tier | when | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | the Metal crate changed, or a declared parity obligation changed | full behavioural qualification (~24 min) |
| **B** | a crate Metal depends on changed, outside any parity obligation | `cargo check --all-targets` + clippy + the ordinary-profile witness (~2 min) |
| **C** | neither | no macOS work |

Tier B is not "trust it". It is the evidence proportional to the claim:
an upstream API change can make the Metal crate **uncompilable**, and a
compile establishes that it did not. It cannot establish that a number
changed — which is why anything that could change a number is tier A by
declaration.

## Architecture

A cheap Linux **triage** job computes the tier and the macOS jobs are
conditional on it. No generated glob list to drift, and no cargo
invocation inside a paths filter:

```
triage (ubuntu, ~30s)  ->  full   (macos-14, if tier == A)
                       ->  compat (macos-14, if tier == B)
```

Dependencies come from `larql-compute-metal/Cargo.toml`, read at triage
time — declared, not inferred. A crate that stops being a dependency
stops being a tier-B trigger with no glob to edit.

**`msrv-metal` folds into `compat`.** It is a compiler-compatibility
claim, and in E1's AFTER window it cost **63.3 macOS queue-minutes to buy
4.3 execution-minutes** — cheap to run, expensive to schedule, which is
precisely the pathology E1's c2 was written to remove and which c2 itself
created. Merging it into the tier-B job removes a whole macOS scheduling
unit.

## The completeness gate

The manifest's weakness is omission: a new parity dependency added
without a declaration would silently classify as B. So
`scripts/metal_tier.py check` extracts every `larql_compute::` /
`larql_models::` path the Metal crate names and fails if any is
undeclared.

The extraction is **approximate** — brace imports (`cpu::{ops, q4}`) and
type imports (`cpu::Foo`) truncate. That is why it is a *check on the
declaration* and never the declaration itself, and the error direction is
the safe one: truncation reports a shallower path, which is harder to
satisfy.

**It does not close every hole.** A fixture that changes its DATA rather
than its signature changes what Metal's tests assert without breaking any
compile and without adding a reference. That is a parity obligation
wearing an interface's clothes, it is recorded as the most likely single
hole in the manifest, and no static check finds it.

## What the sample predicts

Replayed against the manifest (`E2-D-classification.json`):

```
35 pull requests with file data
18 trigger the Metal gate today   (6 metal-touching, 12 upstream-only)

under E2-D:   A = 7    B = 11
```

**11 of 18 triggers (61%) drop from full behavioural qualification to
compile-plus-witness.** Seven stay tier A: #449, #446, #444, #442, #438,
#434 (all touch Metal or its workflow) and #420 (the `needs_review`
default above).

On the measured tier costs — 24 min and ~2 min — that is 18 × 24 = 432
macOS execution-minutes today against 7 × 24 + 11 × 2 = 190. It is also
11 fewer macOS scheduling units, which E1 *hypothesised* is the larger
effect. Be precise about the provenance: E1's **baseline** measurement
found the asymmetry — `quality`'s msrv-macOS leg was 33 jobs, 544
queue-minutes and 22 execution-minutes, cheap to run and expensive to
schedule. E1's **C2**, which would have tested whether removing such jobs
actually wins, came back `INVALID COMPARISON` and is unadjudicated. So
scheduling-unit relief is a live hypothesis inherited from a
pre-intervention measurement, not an established finding, and D4 is the
first prediction that can score it on an intensive metric.

Treat both as arithmetic on a replayed sample, not as a result. They are
what `E2-D-contract.json` will be scored against, not evidence for it.

## The review, resolved (manifest version 2)

All five `needs_review` entries are decided, and two of them were
**wrong**, in the unsafe direction.

| question | answer | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `cpu/kquant_gemv.rs` | **exempt, tier B** | 0 references from the Metal crate; its only consumer outside `larql-compute` is `larql-vindex` |
| `cpu/nvfp4_gemv.rs` | parity | 42 references, including `shaders/nvfp4_matvec.rs` |
| `cpu/spin_pool.rs` | **silent parity** | 0 references, and `attention/decode/gqa_step.rs:125` calls `spin_pool::global().for_each_chunk()` — reduction ORDER inside a parity surface |
| `cpu::q4` | already covered | a re-export of `ops::q4_common`, `ops::q4_matvec`, `ops::q4_vecmat` |
| `backend/{capability,factory}.rs` | exempt, tier B | `pub enum Capability` with a false-returning default impl; `pub enum BackendKind` plus registry, `as_str`, Display |
| `pipeline`, `pipeline_layer` | parity | `test_pipeline_and_moe.rs` builds `FullPipelineLayer` and calls `prefill_kquant`, exercising the `dispatch_full_pipeline` + `moe_fn` chain |
| `options.rs` | **silent parity** | exposes `decode_options()` and `spin_pool_enabled()`; its own docs say "decode fast path — default ON", "force the f32/rayon path" |
| `test_fixtures.rs` (both crates) | **silent parity** | the input DATA the assertions are written against |

### A third class, not a reassignment

`options.rs` and the fixtures were filed as `interface_only` in version 1
on the argument that a compile catches a change. A compile catches a
**signature** change, which is not the hazard. Both belong to a class the
version-1 taxonomy had no room for:

> **`silent_parity_obligations`** — changes WHICH values appear without
> computing any. Path selection, reduction order, fixture data. Tier A on
> the same terms as parity, but **no static check can find them**: they
> add no reference and break no signature.

`metal_tier.py check` therefore *lists* them on every run and says it
cannot verify them. `spin_pool.rs` prints as `NOT referenced — either way
it stays tier A`, which is the class stating its own nature.

They exist as a separate class for one reason: a future reviewer looking
at `test_fixtures.rs` will reason "nothing imports it, it is test
scaffolding, it is structural" and demote it. The class name and its
`do_not_simplify` note exist to stop that.

### Precedence, and an invariant that does not depend on it

Classification order is: **silent parity → the Metal crate and its
workflow → `interface_only` → ordinary parity → the dependency floor.**

Silent parity is first because its members live *inside* broad parity
subtrees — `spin_pool.rs` is under `cpu/**` — so testing ordinary parity
first would swallow them. The tier would still be A, but the reason would
read as ordinary parity and the class would lose the identity it exists
to carry. `interface_only` stays above ordinary parity because that is
how the named exemptions escape their enclosing subtrees.

**Ordering is not the safety property.** In version 2 `interface_only`
was tested first, so an entry overlapping a silent path would have
demoted it to tier B — the one unsafe direction. No such overlap existed,
so nothing was wrong in practice and no test would have caught it. An
invariant that holds only because of evaluation order is one refactor
from not holding, so `metal_tier.py check` now **refuses the overlap
outright** and calls it malformed authority. Four controls cover it,
including one on the shipped manifest and one asserting the demotion is
impossible even when the overlap is constructed deliberately.

### The asymmetry, applied structurally

Parity subtrees stay **whole** and exemptions are **named files**. A file
added to `cpu/` or `backend/` tomorrow defaults to tier A rather than
falling through to tier B. Two selftest controls hold that.

### A limit the review did not remove

**#420 is still tier A**, and not because of `kquant_gemv.rs` — that is
now exempt, along with its test module. It is tier A because it added
five lines to `crates/larql-compute/src/cpu/mod.rs`, and that module root
carries both inert `pub mod` declarations and the `pub mod q4 { pub use
super::ops::... }` re-export block that decides which implementation a
Metal reference resolves to. Classification is per file; a module root is
one file.

So the review moved **zero** pull requests in the sample — A=7, B=11,
unchanged. An earlier draft of this document predicted it would move one.
That prediction was wrong, and the reason is worth more than the
prediction: exempting a leaf does not help when the diff also touches the
root that re-exports it. Do not paper over this by exempting a module
root; going below file granularity is a different and much harder design.

## Before activation

1. **A1 closes** (n ≥ 8 successful Metal runs under E2-A).
2. ~~The five `needs_review` entries~~ — **done**, manifest version 2.
3. ~~The instrument gains a job-scoped metric~~ — **done**.
   `job_exec_max.<workflow>.<job>` counts successful jobs only, returns
   `NO DATA` rather than `PARTIAL` when the job is absent from either
   sample, and is validated against a baseline snapshot for any frozen
   forecast. A selftest control demonstrates the mixture it prevents: a
   24-minute and a 2-minute job in one workflow read as 24 and 2, where
   the workflow-level p50 reads 13.
4. `E2-D-contract.json` freezes with numeric baselines taken from the
   post-E2-A steady state, which does not exist yet.

## Later, not now: E2-E

GitHub evaluates a `pull_request` paths filter against the **whole PR
diff**, not the latest push — observed on #450, where a docs-only commit
retriggered the full Metal gate because the pull request as a whole edits
the workflow. So once a pull request contains a tier-A change, every
later push re-pays tier A, including pushes that only edit prose.

The fix would be to **reuse a successful qualification when the exact set
of inputs capable of invalidating it has not changed** — which needs a
relevant-input digest covering base and merge state, not "the latest
commit touched no Metal files". That is the same ancestry inference this
document rejects, one layer up.

**Not part of D.** D changes which pull requests enter the population; E
would change how often an entered one re-pays. Two mechanisms, two
experiments.
